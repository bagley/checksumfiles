central db (sqlite or mysql) that holds all files info,
inode, size, mod date, and other stat info,
so on renames or moves the file does not have to be rehashed

local .FolderContents.sha1 file for transfering out of the system
Top part is XXXXXXXXXXX  File.txt
Bottom is null? delimited list of all file info, except inode
mod date, checksum, size, name
size<>checksum<>mod-date<>file

Checking and Updating checksum info:
data1 ... Ok
data2 ... Renamed
data3 ... Warning! File has been changed or corrupted
data4 ... No such file
data5 ... Checksum missing ... Generating ... Done
data5 ... Checksum missing ... Skipping

data1 ... Generating ... Done
data2 ... Access Denied
data3 ... Already Done

-------------------------------------------------
Future:

--show-duplicates --sd

inotify? inotify -> on access, checksum file
